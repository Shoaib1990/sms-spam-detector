# SMS Spam Detector

This advanced spam detection system leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to accurately identify and filter out spam messages. By utilizing methods such as CountVectorizer and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), the system converts text into numerical representations that capture the importance of words and their frequency of occurrence within the dataset.

#### Key Features:

- Dual Functionality: Designed to detect spam in both SMS and email messages.
- CountVectorizer: Converts text messages into a matrix of token counts, enabling the model to recognize common spam terms and patterns.
- TF-IDF: Enhances the CountVectorizer by adjusting the frequency of terms based on their importance, reducing the weight of commonly used words that are less informative.
- Machine Learning Models: Utilizes algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines to classify messages as spam or legitimate.
- High Accuracy: Achieves high accuracy through extensive training on labeled datasets, ensuring reliable spam detection.

This spam detector is a robust tool for improving the quality and security of communication by effectively filtering out unwanted and potentially harmful messages.
